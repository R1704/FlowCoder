\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{cyan}{}{cyan!25}{\leavevmode {\color {cyan!25}o}}\ From \cite {ciaunica_nested_2023}: “Self-organization is typically defined as the spontaneous emergence of spatiotemporal order or pattern-formation processes in physical and biological systems resulting from interactions of its components with the environment (Camazine et al. 2001; Seeley 2002, Rosas et al. 2018). Properties of a global higher level system emerge from—and are dependent upon—interactions of its components at the lower level. For example, when the wind blows over a uniform surface of sand, a pattern of regularly spaced ranges emerges (cf. FIG. 1) as a combination of gravity forces and wind speed act on the sand particles (Forrest and Haff 1992). In turn, the surface of the sand determines the flow of air, shaping the reports. Self-organisation therefore entails both bottom-up and top-down causation (Ellis et al., 2011) that is reflected in the circular” “causality implicit in the enslaving principle (Haken \& Portugali, 2016) in synergetics or the centre manifold theorem in dynamical systems theory (Carr, 1981).” “However, biological organization is more than emergent complexity. It is fundamentally composed of nested goal-seeking (homeostatic and allostatic) agents, ranging from molecular pathways to whole organ systems and beyond. These not only exhibit complex behaviour, but also specifically act to minimize and maximize various quantities and solve problems by navigating (with diverse degrees of competency) a variety of spaces including transcriptional, physiological, and anatomical spaces in addition to the familiar space of behaviour (Fields \& Levin, 2022).”}{12}{section*.38}%

\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{cyan}{}{cyan!25}{\leavevmode {\color {cyan!25}o}}\ the DSL is given by a set of primitives together with their (possibly polymorphic) types and semantics. We describe the machine learning pipeline for program synthesis, illustrated in Figure 1 on a toy DSL describing integer list manipulating programs. The compilation phase constructs a context-free grammar (CFG) from the DSL together with a set of syntactic constraints. The CFG may incorporate important information about the program being generated, such as the n last primitives (encompassing n-gram models) or semantic information (e.g. non- zero integer, sorted list). A prediction model (typically a neural network) takes as inputs a set of I/O and outputs a probabilistic labelling of the CFG, inducing a probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG). The network is trained so that most likely pro- grams (with respect to the PCFG) are the most likely to be solutions, meaning map the inputs to corresponding outputs. We refer to Appendix A for an in-depth technical discussion on program representations and on the compilation phase. In this work we focus on the search phase and start with defining a theoretical framework for analysing search algorithms. The PCFG obtained through the predictions of the neural network defines a probabilistic distribution D over programs. We make the theoretical assumption that the program we are looking for is actually sampled from D, and construct algorithms searching through programs which find programs sampled from D as quickly as possible. Formally, the goal is to minimise the expected number of programs the algorithm outputs before finding the right program. }{29}{section*.65}%
