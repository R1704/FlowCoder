\begin{abstract}
    I posit that the construction of our conceptual architecture, abides by the same principles as any hierarchical self-organising system, namely discernment about what it is and what it is not.

%     \item[computational] Why do things work the way they do?
%     What is the goal of the computation?
%     What are the unifying principles?
%     here we describe the problem as a self-organizing system, building hierarchical generative models. 
%     \item[algorithmic] What representations can implement
%     such computations? 
%     How does the choice of representations
%     determine the algorithm? 
%     Here we describe the FEP and how the discrimination between me and world gives rise to self-organization
%     Here we take the stance of a LOT and talk about the benefits of a symbolic paradigm although this could also be done in other ways, e.g. GLOM
%     \item[implementational] here we talk about program synthesis and combinatorial search, MCMC, RL, DreamCoder, etc.
