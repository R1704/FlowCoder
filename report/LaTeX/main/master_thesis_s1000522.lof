\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {11}{\ignorespaces The plot displays the cumulative number of tasks solved (y-axis) against the number of steps (x-axis). Each step represents an iteration in the E-M cycle. The initial 2.000 steps correspond to the first E-step, marked with a blue background, followed by the first M-step spanning the next 2.000 steps (up to step 4.000), distinguished by a purple background. This pattern constitutes one complete epoch. The graph includes a dotted line representing the average number of tasks solved over all epochs, offering a benchmark for comparison. Furthermore, the intensity of the color hue in the plot encodes the temporal sequence of the epochs: brighter bars on the left signify earlier epochs (the first epoch), with the hue gradually darkening towards the right, culminating in the fifth and final epoch.\relax }}{33}{figure.caption.41}%
