\section{Introduction}

\section{Origin of Cognition}
- Cognition and the computational boundary of the self
- What am "I", what am "I" not? Discernment
- Going through nested hierarchies
- Self organization
\section{Bayesian inference and FEP}


\subsection{Bayesian Inference}
- separating the recognition and generative model (sys 1, 2)
- causality (DAG) vs correlation
- why llms are not enough

\section{language of thought}
- follows holarchic principle
- formal grammar (downfall of GOFAI)
- hope with neurosymbolic models

\section{probabilistic paradigm}
- computational mind
- partial programs as concepts
- dehaene symbols
- dreamcoder

\section{symbolic and connectionist approaches of concepts and cognition}
- how do we create concepts
- what do we model? Interoceptive, introceptive, proprioception, sensorimotor information, etc. 
- features, objects, concepts, thoughts, ideas, beliefs, ideologies, world views, etc. 
- llms
- what is meaning
- what is understanding
- what is truth
