\chapter{Discussion}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Discuss Bayesian causal inference
    \item Amortized sampling/ amortized inference
    \item Are these the most promising tools to research complex systems?
    \item Do we need a language of thought? (reference to JB, a chair isnt true or false, only a description can be true of false)
    \item Then, does the language have to be symbolic, or not? 
    \item Can a representation of a word, of natural language be seen as a symbol? yes, it points to something, and we know that we can work in language without the meaning, the underlying understanding. 
    \item 
\end{itemize}

\section{Implications/ Consequences of the theory}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Memes as exlicit cultural concepts of a super-organism
    \item Cognitive light cone view of cancer and psychopaths (also in a game-theoretic view)
    \item Describing systems as levels in a holarchy. We can describe groups, families, companies, corporations, (think noah harari and money is invented) as an organism and ask whether it is conscious. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Summarise main findings and especially relate them to the questions. What have we learned about identity and the question "Who am I?"
    \item Understanding, goals, models, etc. 
\end{itemize}
