# FlowCoder

FlowCoder is a novel program synthesizer that synergizes the symbolic and subsymbolic paradigms by embedding programs within a Transformer-based implicit
world model and utilizing Generative Flow Network (GFlowNet) for program inference. FlowCoder
demonstrates an ability in extrapolating to Out-of-Distribution tasks and performing eﬃcient one-shot inference,
given suﬃcient training. 
It uses [DeepSynth](https://github.com/nathanael-fijalkow/DeepSynth) as a framework that facilitates a type system, program representations and associated techniques.
